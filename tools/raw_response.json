      "detail": "Time decay, measured by Theta, is a crucial factor for options traders. Options lose value as they get closer to expiration because there is less time for the underlying asset to move favorably. This decay accelerates as expiration approaches, especially for at-the-money options. Short-dated options often have higher variance premiums and faster time decay, making them attractive for options sellers looking to profit from this erosion of extrinsic value.",

      "detail": "While the BSM model suggests the underlying asset's direction doesn't influence option pricing (due to risk-neutrality), options are still widely used for directional bets.

Option pricing models like BSM operate under risk-neutral probabilities, which simplify calculations by assuming investors are indifferent to risk. However, real-world investors are risk-averse and demand compensation for bearing risk, leading to 'actual' probabilities that incorporate risk premiums. Understanding this distinction is crucial for traders who aim to profit from these differences, as it explains why options might be systematically 'overpriced' from a risk-neutral perspective but rationally priced in the actual world due to risk aversion.",

It involves buying an at-the-money (ATM) call and selling an out-of-the-money (OTM) call. This strategy reduces the initial cost and caps the maximum loss, which can aid in psychological comfort.
