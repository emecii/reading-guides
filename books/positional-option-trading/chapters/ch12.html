          <p>The Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model's foundational assumption of a single, constant risk-free interest rate deviates from market reality, where rates vary across bid-ask spreads and yield curves. While large financial institutions manage interest rate risks, independent traders typically forgo hedging due to prohibitive transaction costs. Empirically, errors in interest rate inputs have a minimal impact on option pricing and delta, and even incorporating stochastic interest rates offers negligible improvements in pricing accuracy.</p>
          <p>Another core BSM assumption is the absence of dividends. To rectify this, options are priced by subtracting the present value of expected dividends from the underlying stock price. This adjustment is relatively straightforward and can also be applied to situations where stocks become difficult to borrow, reflecting the cost of carrying a short position.</p>

          <p>The BSM model's oversight of varying tax implications among investors complicates its accuracy, as different tax rates can lead to distinct option valuations. While some empirical studies indicate minor price discrepancies attributable to tax effects, these are often insufficient for comprehensive analysis, making a universally tax-adjusted pricing model impractical.</p>
          <p>The BSM framework fundamentally relies on the ability to trade and short the underlying asset for effective hedging. In scenarios where the underlying is illiquid or cannot be shorted, the no-arbitrage conditions underpinning BSM break down, leading to potential mispricing. In such cases, traders may resort to a 'real options' approach or utilize imperfectly correlated traded assets for approximate valuations.</p>

          <p>Perhaps the most significant deviation from BSM's assumptions is the reality of non-constant volatility. This leads to phenomena like the 'volatility smile' or 'surface,' where implied volatility varies across different strikes and maturities. Market makers typically address this by using a modified BSM model that incorporates a different volatility for each strike, which they update periodically. While more complex stochastic volatility models exist, they often lead to more variable day-to-day P&L.</p>
          <p>Despite its many clearly incorrect assumptions, the BSM model remains an industry standard due to its simplicity, widespread implementation, and the intuitive framework it provides for trader communication. Most of its fundamental assumptions can be corrected through simple, albeit sometimes ad-hoc, adjustments, making it a highly practical and enduring tool for options trading.</p>

        <div class="example-icon">💸</div>
        <div class="example-title">Interest Rate Impact</div>
        <div class="example-desc">A trader uses the BSM model assuming a 5% risk-free rate. If the actual borrowing rate is 6% and lending is 4%, the single rate assumption is flawed. However, the impact on delta and option pricing for short-dated options is often negligible compared to volatility changes.</div>
        <div class="example-lesson">While BSM's interest rate assumption is imperfect, its practical impact on short-term option pricing is often minimal.</div>

        <div class="example-title">Dividend Adjustment</div>
        <div class="example-desc">A company announces a dividend payment before an option's expiration. To use the BSM model, the trader manually subtracts the present value of this expected dividend from the stock price, effectively reducing the stock's value in the model to reflect the cash payout.</div>

        <div class="example-title">Volatility Smile</div>
        <div class="example-desc">A trader observes that out-of-the-money put options on a stock have a higher implied volatility than at-the-money options, forming a 'volatility smile'. This contradicts BSM's constant volatility assumption. Market makers adjust by using different implied volatilities for each strike.</div>
        <div class="example-lesson">The volatility smile/skew demonstrates non-constant volatility, requiring BSM adjustments for realistic pricing.</div>

        <div class="example-title">Illiquid Underlying</div>
        <div class="example-desc">A trader wants to price an option on a private company's shares, which cannot be easily traded or shorted. The BSM model's hedging mechanism breaks down. Instead, they might use a 'real options' approach or find a publicly traded, highly correlated asset for valuation.</div>
        <div class="example-lesson">The inability to hedge the underlying asset renders traditional BSM pricing ineffective, necessitating alternative valuation methods.</div>
