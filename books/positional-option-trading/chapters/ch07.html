          <p>While the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model theoretically suggests that the direction of an underlying asset does not influence option pricing (due to its risk-neutral framework), options are widely used for directional betting. Many traders engage in directional trading, often primarily through buying options, despite the inherent complexities.</p>
          <p>Predicting the underlying asset's direction is challenging, and it's possible for a trader to be correct about the direction but still incur losses, typically due to the cost of the option premium or insufficient price movement. Options allow for more nuanced speculation than simple up or down bets. Subjective option pricing models, unlike BSM's dynamic hedging, allow traders to introduce their own 'drift' or expected returns into personal pricing, helping to determine appropriate options when anticipating specific market movements.</p>

          <p>The theory of subjective option pricing asserts that option prices can be derived by assuming cash is invested at a risk-free rate, while incorporating different expected returns for cash and stock. Generalized BSM models can be adapted to include these subjective drift estimates, allowing traders to align option valuations with their individual market forecasts.</p>
          <p>Analysis of option returns reveals a significant difference between risk-neutral and actual probabilities. Options inherently possess positive skewness, meaning they have the potential for large positive payoffs, irrespective of the underlying asset's return distribution. Understanding the complex moments of option returns often necessitates simulations to properly grasp their behavior under various scenarios.</p>

          <p>Selecting the optimal strike price in options trading is a multi-faceted decision, involving the consideration of various risk measurements and being highly dependent on a trader's personal risk tolerance. There is no universal 'best' option; instead, traders must evaluate different criteria for 'best' options, such as average dollar profit, percentage return, or probability of profit, to maximize their utility based on individual goals.</p>
          <p>Different performance metrics, like the Sharpe ratio and generalized Sharpe ratio (GSR), can provide varied insights, further complicating a straightforward answer for optimal strike selection. Ultimately, traders should leverage their subjective models, informed by unique market forecasts and personal trading strategies, to determine the options that best align with their objectives and risk profiles.</p>

        <div class="example-desc">A trader correctly predicts that a stock will rise significantly. They buy an out-of-the-money call option, but the stock's rise is slower and less volatile than expected, causing the option to expire worthless due to time decay, resulting in a loss.</div>
        <div class="example-lesson">Predicting direction is not enough; the magnitude and speed of the move, along with time decay, are critical for option profitability.</div>

        <div class="example-title">Subjective Drift in Pricing</div>
        <div class="example-desc">A trader believes a specific tech stock has an inherent growth rate (drift) higher than the market consensus. They use a modified BSM model that incorporates this personal drift estimate to identify call options they perceive as undervalued by the market's standard risk-neutral pricing.</div>

        <div class="example-title">Positive Skewness of Options</div>
        <div class="example-desc">While a stock's returns might be normally distributed, buying an OTM call option on that stock offers a small chance of a very large payoff, creating a positively skewed return profile for the option. Most options expire worthless, but the few winners can be substantial.</div>
